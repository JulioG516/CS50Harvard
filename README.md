# CS50 Course by Harvard University
This repository contains my submissions for the CS50 course offered by Harvard University. CS50 is an introductory course in computer science that covers a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, computer architecture, programming languages, software development, and more.

# Course Overview
The CS50 course is designed to be accessible to beginners and provides a solid foundation for further study in computer science. The course is structured around a series of lectures, problem sets, and projects. The lectures cover the theoretical concepts and practical applications of computer science, while the problem sets and projects allow students to apply what they have learned in practice.

# Submissions
# This repository contains my submissions for the CS50 course. Here is a brief overview of the submissions:

### pset1 - C: This problem set involved implementing several programs in C, including a program that simulates a cash register and a program that recovers deleted files from a memory card.

### pset2 - Crypto: This problem set involved implementing a program in C that encrypts messages using the Vigenere cipher, as well as a program that decrypts messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher.

### pset3 - Game of Fifteen: This problem set involved implementing the Game of Fifteen in C, which is a puzzle game where the player must arrange the numbers 1 to 15 in order.

### pset4 - Recover and Resize: This problem set involved implementing two programs in C. The first program, Recover, recovers deleted JPEG images from a memory card. The second program, Resize, resizes BMP images.

### pset5 - Spell Checker: This problem set involved implementing a spell checker in C, using a hash table to store a dictionary of words and checking the spelling of input text against that dictionary.

### pset6 - Python: This problem set involved implementing several programs in Python, including a program that translates text from English to French and a program that generates mario-style pyramids.

### pset7 - Flask: This problem set involved creating a web application using Flask and SQLite, where users can register, log in, and buy and sell stocks.

### pset8 - Mashup: This problem set involved creating a web application that uses Google Maps and the Google News API to display news articles and locations on a map.

### FitBalance - FitBalance is a fitness tracking web application that allows users to track their daily calorie intake, log their exercises, and monitor their progress towards their fitness goals. This application was built as a final project.
# Conclusion
The CS50 course is an excellent introduction to computer science, covering a wide range of topics and providing practical experience through its problem sets and projects. The submissions in this repository demonstrate my understanding and application of the concepts covered in the course, from programming in C to web development using Flask.
